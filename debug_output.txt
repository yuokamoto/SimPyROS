SimPyROS 3D Visualization Demo
Usage: python visualization_demo.py [static|<real_time_factor>]
  static - Static visualization
  <number> - Real-time factor (1.0=real-time, 0.5=half speed, 2.0=double speed)

Running animated simulation demo (speed: 20.0x)...
- Objects: Robot (blue), Sensor (green), Target (red), Obstacles (gray/brown)
- Press Ctrl+C to stop
- Animation speed: 20.0x faster than real-time
