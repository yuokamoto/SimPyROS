# ===== Numerical Computing =====
numpy>=1.20.0             # Array operations and mathematical functions
scipy>=1.7.0              # Scientific computing (spatial transformations)

# ===== 3D Visualization (Primary) =====
pyvista>=0.40.0           # High-quality 3D visualization and mesh handling
vtk>=9.0.0                # VTK backend for PyVista

# ===== URDF Robot Model Support (Core) =====
# Modern URDF parsing (primary, used by urdf_loader.py and robot.py)
yourdfpy>=0.0.6           # Modern URDF parsing library (recommended)

# Mesh processing and 3D model support
trimesh>=3.15.0           # 3D mesh processing (for URDF mesh files)

# ===== Development and Testing =====
# Optional but useful for development
matplotlib>=3.5.0         # For legacy examples and plotting (optional)

# ===== Optional Advanced Features =====
# Uncomment these for advanced functionality:
# pandas>=1.3.0           # Data analysis and CSV export
# pillow>=8.0.0           # Image processing for screenshots
# h5py>=3.0.0             # HDF5 data storage
# opencv-python>=4.5.0    # Computer vision features
# robotics-toolbox-python>=0.11.0  # Advanced robotics algorithms

# ===== Notes =====
# Standard library modules used (built-in, no installation needed):
# - math, time, sys, os, pathlib, json, threading
# - typing, dataclasses, enum, warnings, traceback
# - xml.etree.ElementTree (for XML parsing)
#
# Current examples coverage:
# - examples/basic/*: Core dependencies only
# - examples/pyvista/*: All main dependencies (recommended entry point)  
# - examples/robot_demo.py: Full robot functionality with URDF support
# - tests/*: Core dependencies for testing
#
# Legacy compatibility:
# - legacy/* folder: May require matplotlib and other optional dependencies
# - unused/* folder: Not maintained, dependencies not guaranteed
