# SimPyROS Core Requirements
# Essential dependencies for running examples/

# Core simulation framework
simpy>=4.0.0

# Numerical computing and transformations
numpy>=1.20.0
scipy>=1.7.0

# Primary 3D visualization (PyVista examples - recommended)
pyvista>=0.40.0
vtk>=9.0.0

# Standard library modules used: math, time, sys, os, traceback
# These are built-in Python modules and don't need to be installed

# Current examples dependencies:
# - basic/basic_demo.py: Only uses core dependencies (already included)
# - pyvista/*: Uses PyVista and core dependencies (already included)

# Legacy examples (in legacy/ directory) require additional dependencies
# but are not included here to keep main installation minimal:
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For legacy/examples/visualization_demo.py

# Development/Optional dependencies:
# pandas>=1.3.0      # For advanced data analysis
# pyyaml>=6.0        # For configuration files
# h5py>=3.0.0        # For HDF5 data storage
