#### 10. Revolutionary Architecture Simplification ✅
- **✅ Single Loop Architecture**: Eliminated multiple while loops in favor of centralized update management
  ```python
  # OLD: Multiple independent loops with yield statements
  SimulationManager._simulation_process_loop()  # while True + yield
  Robot._joint_control_loop()                  # while True + yield  
  SimulationObject._update_loop()              # while True + yield
  
  # NEW: Single centralized loop with direct method calls
  SimulationManager._simulation_process_loop():
      for robot in robots: robot.update_joints_if_needed(sim_time)
      for obj in objects: obj.update_if_needed(sim_time)
      yield env.timeout(time_step)
  ```
- **✅ Simplified Process Management**: Reduced from 3+ SimPy processes to 1 main process
- **✅ Eliminated Process Synchronization Complexity**: No more inter-process coordination needed
- **✅ Performance Optimization**: Significant reduction in SimPy process management overhead

#### 11. Enhanced Update System ✅
- **✅ sim_time Based Updates**: All objects update based on actual simulation time, not intervals
  ```python
  def update_if_needed(self, current_sim_time: float) -> bool:
      if current_sim_time >= self._last_update_sim_time + self.update_interval:
          self._update_state()
          return True
  ```
- **✅ Precise Update Frequency Control**: Each object maintains its own update timing independently

## Current Technical Architecture (Post-Centralization)

### Centralized Update Flow Architecture
```
SimulationManager._simulation_process_loop()
    ↓ (single while loop with yield)
advance_sim_time() → current_sim_time
    ↓ (centralized time management)
for robot in robots:
    robot.update_joints_if_needed(current_sim_time)  # Joint control at 100Hz
    robot.update_if_needed(current_sim_time)         # Base motion updates
    ↓ (direct method calls, no processes)
for obj in objects:
    obj.update_if_needed(current_sim_time)           # Custom update rates
    ↓ (sim_time based timing)
for callback in control_callbacks:
    callback.call_if_needed(current_sim_time)        # User control logic
