# Beginner Examples

Simple examples to get started with SimPyROS. These demonstrate basic functionality and are perfect for learning the fundamentals.

## Examples

### `basic_simulation.py`
**Recommended starting point** - Simple robot simulation with basic movement and visualization.

**Features:**
- Single robot with URDF loading
- Basic movement control
- Interactive visualization
- Real-time factor control

**Run:**
```bash
cd examples/beginner
python basic_simulation.py
```

**What you'll learn:**
- Creating a SimulationManager
- Loading robots from URDF files
- Setting up control callbacks
- Using visualization controls

## Prerequisites

- Activate the virtual environment: `source simpyros-env/bin/activate`
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of coordinate systems

## Next Steps

After completing these examples, move on to:
- **Intermediate examples** for object connections and external meshes
- **Advanced examples** for complex behaviors and multi-robot coordination
